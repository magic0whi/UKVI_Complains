Formal Complaint Regarding Unjust Visa Refusals and Alleged Professional Misconduct - GWF070111602 & GWF069528864

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally lodge a complaint concerning the refusals of my UK Visitor Visa applications (references GWF070111602 and GWF069528864), dated 17 May 2023 and 3 April 2023, respectively. I believe these refusals were not only unjust but also indicative of serious professional misconduct, warranting a thorough investigation.

Details of the Incident:
- Application References: GWF070111602 and GWF069528864
- Dates of Refusal: 17 May 2023 and 3 April 2023
- Decision-Making Body: UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)

- Nature of Complaint:
  - Unjustified Assumptions:
    The refusal letters implied that I, a financially stable individual from the Yangtze River Delta region, intended to engage in illegal employment in the UK. This assumption is baseless and has caused significant distress.
  - Impact on Mental Health:
    I have a history of severe depression, and these unfounded accusations have exacerbated my condition, leading to considerable emotional distress.
  - Professional Misconduct:
    The conduct of the visa officers involved appears to lack impartiality and fairness, potentially constituting serious professional misconduct. Such behaviour undermines the integrity of the visa issuance process.

Exceptional Circumstances for Delayed Complaint:
I acknowledge that this complaint is being submitted beyond the standard three-month period. However, the profound impact on my mental health and the severity of the alleged misconduct constitute exceptional circumstances that justify this delay.

Requested Actions:
- Formal Investigation:
  Initiate a comprehensive investigation into the conduct of the visa officers responsible for processing my applications to determine if professional misconduct occurred.
- Formal Apology:
  Issue a formal written apology acknowledging the unjust treatment and the distress caused by the unfounded assumptions in the refusal letters.
- Compensation:
  Donate this misappropriated Â£200 amount to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in my name, reflecting my support for digital rights.

Transparency Notice:
- Please be aware that all correspondence related to this complaint will be made publicly available on my GitHub repository: https://github.com/magic0whi/UKVI_Complains. This measure is intended to ensure full transparency in the handling of this matter.
- This is the second complaint email I have sent.

I trust that UKVI will address this complaint with the seriousness it warrants and take appropriate action to rectify the situation.

Yours faithfully,
Junzhe Qian
