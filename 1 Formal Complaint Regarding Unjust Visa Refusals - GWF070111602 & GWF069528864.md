Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Unjust Visa Refusals - GWF070111602 & GWF069528864

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally complain about the refusals of my UK Visitor Visa applications (GWF070111602 & GWF069528864), dated 17 May 2023 and 3 April 2023. I firmly believe that these refusals were not only unjustified but also an unwarranted insult to my character. The reasoning given by the visa officer was absurd, and I find it offensive that they would suspect someone like me—a financially stable individual from the Yangtze River Delta—of intending to work illegally in the UK.

## Grounds for Complaint

- Incorrect Assumption About My Father's Location and Role

  The refusal letter dated 17 May 2023 states that my father is in the UK and that he is my "sponsor." However, this is incorrect. My father resides in China, not the UK. I did not apply under a visa category that requires a formal "sponsor" as in work or study visas. My father's financial support is not a sponsorship in that sense—it simply ensures that I have the necessary funds for my visit. His role was misinterpreted in my application assessment.

- Failure to Recognize My Ties to China
  
  I am a full-time university student in China and have no reason to overstay in the UK. My enrolment and financial situation clearly show my intention to return after my visit.

  Additionally, I must admit that I have not lived alone outside my home for an extended period. As a result, I do not have a strong understanding of the expenses or sense of belonging that come with long-term travel. After past travel experiences to places like Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong, I have found that after about a week away, I begin to feel a strong desire to return home. This natural tendency further confirms that I have no intention of overstaying my visa.

- Unfounded Doubts About My Financial Situation
  My application included financial documents proving that I have sufficient personal funds and that my father can provide financial support if needed. However, the refusal suggests that my financial standing was not adequately demonstrated.

- Unfair Scrutiny of My Relationship with My Girlfriend
  
  The first refusal (3 April 2023) raised doubts about my relationship with my girlfriend, despite evidence of our connection.

  The second refusal (17 May 2023) questioned my girlfriend's student status in the UK, even though this had no direct impact on my eligibility as a visitor.

- Lack of Detailed Travel Plans Due to My Travel Style

  This was my first attempt to travel abroad, and I generally prefer spontaneous travel rather than rigid itineraries. I go where I feel like, and I rarely make long-term plans.

  I now realize that there is a unwritten rule in UK visa applications that requires structured planning, especially regarding return flights. I sincerely apologize for not including this in my initial application.

- Lack of Transparent and Fair Assessment

  The refusals appear to be based on speculation rather than an objective review of the documents I submitted. I was not given an opportunity to clarify any doubts before my application was denied.

## My Requests

- A formal written apology

  I demand an official written apology from UKVI, signed and stamped, recognizing the unjust and baseless nature of my visa refusals.

- Compensation in the form of a Charitable Donation

  The £200 visa fee I paid was effectively misappropriated due to the unfair handling of my applications. As compensation, I request that this amount be donated in my name to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), as I identify as a geek and support digital rights.

## Public Transparency and Ongoing Action:

I'm suffering from severe depression, and the unfair nature of these refusals has only added to my distress. I have since developed a strong negative impression of the UK. Therefore, I'm no longer having interest in travelling to England, even though my girlfriend is still studying there.

However, I will not let this insult go unanswered. This is my first letter of complaint, but will not be my last. I will continue to send this complaint every week for the rest of my life unless my requests are acknowledged. Furthermore, all correspondence between myself and UKVI, as well as any information I provide, will be made fully public at: https://github.com/magic0whi/UKVI_Complains (WIP, there's a lot of information to gather, organize and translate.)

I expect a response addressing my concerns, and I hope UKVI is capable of handling this matter with the fairness and accountability it claims to uphold.

Sincerely,
Junzhe Qian
